Visualizations-using-SAP-Lumira
===============================

Data (Afgan War Diary) obtained from www.wikileaks.org
One cannot get the whole picture from the documents alone unless he/she puts some effort into it. To do away with it, and produce a visual summary of the data I used SAP Lumira.
My goal was to show the death toll (of the civilians, host, enemies and friendly units) in the Afganisthan War in a neat, concise manner.
Of all the visualizations that I tried out the 3D column chart was the best that catered to my needs. It neatly presents the count of casualities for each of the regions where the war was concentrated. My other visualizations did also meet this goal, like the tag cloud which effectively categorizes any given day as a good or bad day for the host.
In most of the visualizations the count of wounded/killed is the measure, and the region, type of attack, category etc as the attributes.
